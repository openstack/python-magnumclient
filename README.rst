Python bindings to the Magnum API
=================================

This is a client library for Magnum built on the Magnum API. It
provides a Python API (the ``magnumclient`` module) and a command-line
tool (``magnum``).

Development takes place via the usual OpenStack processes as outlined
in the `developer guide
<http://docs.openstack.org/infra/manual/developers.html>`_.
